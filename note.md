 - take a sample of train data 
 - grid search can be used to find the best values of parameters C and gamma.
 - After achieving a decent score, I increased the sample size and again ran the algorithm for different combination of parameters. The values that yielded best scores in my case were: kernel - rbf, C - 7, gamma - 0.009
